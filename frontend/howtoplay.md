# 🃏 How to Play

### 1. Deck  
The game uses 6 cards: **Ace**, **King**, **Queen**, **Jack**, and **2 Jokers**.

### 2. Game Start  
- Each player gets **5 cards**.  
- One non-Joker card is revealed as the **round card** (e.g., "Ace Round").

### 3. Playing a Turn  
- Choose **1–3 cards** from your hand.  
-  **“Throw Cards”** to play and claim they match the round card.

### 4. Next Player’s Choice  
- **Throw Cards** to continue the claim, or  
-  **“Call Liar”** to challenge the last play.

  - If the last player was lying: they **lose 1 chance**.  
  - If they were honest: the **caller loses 1 chance**.

### 5. Joker Rules  
- Jokers are **wild cards** that can match any card.  
- Example: 2 Kings + 1 Joker = 3 Kings in a King round.

### 6. Forced "Call Liar" Rule  
- If the last player used their final cards, and **you have no cards**, you're **forced to “Call Liar”**.  
- If **you still have cards**, you can either “Call Liar” or “Throw Cards” to continue — which may **force the next player** (who may also have no cards) to **Call Liar**.

### 7. Winning the Game  
- When only **1 player has chances left**, they **win the round** and earn 1 point.  
- The game resets for the next round — play continues until the set number of rounds is reached.
